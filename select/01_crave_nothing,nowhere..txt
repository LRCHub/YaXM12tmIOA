I been quiet but I think I gotta say it
Girl, I want you and it's you that I've been craving
I can see anticipation on your face and I wanna taste it, yeah
I know you see me at the shows that I been playing
When I see you in the crowd, my heart is racing
I can see anticipation on your face and I wanna taste it
Goddamn, lately I been going through it
Crazy how you always do this
Got me looking like I'm stupid
You know I love it how you move it
I been thinking 'bout your body
You say you don't need anybody
I pick you up on my Ducati
I saw me like
Some preach, some pray, some medicate
Some leave, some love, some serenade
I remember I would dream about the better days
Now I think about you like everyday
Some preach, some pray, some medicate
I leave, I love, I serenade
I remember I would dream about the better days
Now I think about you like everyday
I been quiet but I think I gotta say it
Girl, I want you and it's you that I've been craving
I can see anticipation on your face and I wanna taste it, yeah
I been quiet but I think I gotta say it
Girl, I want you and it's you that I've been craving
I can see anticipation on your face and I wanna taste it, yeah
I know you see me at the shows that I been playing
When I see you in the crowd, my heart is racing
I can see anticipation on your face and I wanna taste it
